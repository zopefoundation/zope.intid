4.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.

- Bug fix: ensure that the IntId utility never generates ids greater
  than the maxint of the BTree family being used.

3.7.2 (2009-12-27)
------------------

- Use the zope.component API in favor of ztapi.

- Removed ``zope.app.testing`` dependency.

3.7.1 (2009-05-18)
------------------

- Remove dependencies on ``zope.container``.  Instead import
  ``Object*Event`` classes from ``zope.lifecycleevent`` and import
  ``IContained`` from ``zope.location``.  In order to be able to do
  this, depend on ``zope.lifecycleevent``>=3.5.2 and
  ``zope.location``>=3.5.4.

- Remove a dependency on ``zope.container.contained.Contained``
  (this is a dumb base class that defines __parent__ and __name__
  as None and declares that the class implements IContained).

3.7.0 (2009-02-01)
------------------

- Split out this package from ``zope.app.intid``. The latter one
  now only contains browser views and compatibility imports while
  whole IntId functionality is moved here.
